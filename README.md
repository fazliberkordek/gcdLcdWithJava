# gcdLcdWithJava
This is a Java program that calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two given numbers.

GCD (Greatest Common Divisor):

The GCD of two or more natural numbers is the largest number that divides them evenly. In other words, it is the greatest common factor of the given numbers.

Example: Let's find the GCD of 18 and 24 step by step.

Divisors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18

Divisors of 24: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24

The largest common divisor among these divisors is 6, which is the GCD.

LCM (Least Common Multiple):

The LCM of two or more natural numbers is the smallest number that is divisible by each of the given numbers. In other words, it is the smallest common multiple of the given numbers.

Example: Let's find the LCM of 6 and 8 step by step.

Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, ...

Multiples of 8: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 64, ...

The smallest common multiple among these multiples is 24, which is the LCM.

Formula for LCM using GCD:

LCM = (n1 * n2) / GCD

How to Use the Program:

Input the two numbers for which you want to find the GCD and LCM.
The program will calculate and display the GCD and LCM of the given numbers.
Feel free to use this Java program to find the GCD and LCM of any two numbers. Happy coding!
